This is really fun! I wish the pictures were bigger, and maybe some better styles. maybe a page with a leaderboard; I think this project could be improved by making the interface for the game more intuitive. It was odd trying to hit the go button each play. A separate start game and next challenge button could help; Fun game, liked the different difficulty settings. The high score didn't refresh when I beat it, do I need to refresh the whole page?; Great job. I need to brush up on my Pokemon :P; great job! would like to see bigger pictures, dedicated div's for the picture and maybe some poke facts alongside the pokemon; Twas a good trivia game
Fun game, I'd scale everything up. It's kind of hard to see everything, and change the difficulty button to be radio buttons; Love the game, brings back good childhood memories; Great website, fun game, looks like effort was put in. Maybe just make the buttons a bit fancier or add more spacing between them. Also, the footer is kind of weird.
